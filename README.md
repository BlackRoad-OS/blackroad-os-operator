# Prism Console (Gen-0)

Prism Console is the single-pane-of-glass for every BlackRoad environment. This Gen-0 scaffold ships a minimal Next.js 14 app router shell with dark theming, stubbed data providers, and ready-to-extend UI components.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the console.

### Tests & linting

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

### Production build

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Docker image:

```bash
docker build -f infra/Dockerfile -t blackroad/prism-console:0.0.1 .
docker run -e PORT=3000 -p 3000:3000 blackroad/prism-console:0.0.1
```

## Environment

Configuration is read from standard environment variables such as `BEACON_URL` and `CORE_HUB`. See `infra/prisma-console.env.example` for a starter file.

Generated by Prism-Gen-0 scaffold. Extend with real BEACON and CORE_HUB integrations before release.
