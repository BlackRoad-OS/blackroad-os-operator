"""
BlackRoad Consensus System 🖤

Philosophy: 51% isn't winning when 49% might have a better idea.
We listen to ALL voices. Minority perspectives are integrated, not dismissed.

"It's when we listen to those around us that we truly understand
what we are building and what it means to be alive and be able
to pick decisions and the latter... design them as well."
    - Alexa Amundson, BlackRoad Founder

Consensus Levels:
    - UNANIMOUS (100%): Immediate implementation ✅
    - SUPERMAJORITY (75%+): Implement with minority considerations integrated 🤝
    - MAJORITY (51%+): PAUSE - Minority voice review required 🔄
    - SPLIT (<51%): Synthesis phase - find the solution that serves ALL 💡
    - BLOCKED (any HARD NO): Full stop - address concerns first 🛑

The Consideration Box:
    Anyone can submit a proposal. If it doesn't hurt anyone, we vote.
    Every voice matters. Every perspective shapes the outcome.
