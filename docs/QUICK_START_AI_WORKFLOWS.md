## ✅ Prerequisites

- [ ] Linear account with API access
- [ ] Notion workspace with integration capabilities
- [ ] HuggingFace account (free tier works)
- [ ] BlackRoad OS Operator deployed (Railway)

## 🚀 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Get API Keys (2 minutes)

#### Linear API Key
```bash
1. Go to https://linear.app/settings/api
2. Create new API key
3. Copy: lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Notion Integration Token
```bash
1. Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
2. Click "New integration"
3. Name: "BlackRoad AI Workflows"
4. Copy: secret_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### HuggingFace Token (optional)
```bash
1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Create new token (read access)
3. Copy: hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 2. Add Environment Variables (1 minute)

In Railway or `.env`:

```bash
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPERATOR_WEBHOOK_URL=https://operator.blackroad.systems

# Optional (for higher rate limits)
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 3. Setup Linear Webhook (1 minute)

```bash
1. Linear → Settings → Webhooks
2. URL: https://operator.blackroad.systems/webhooks/linear
3. Events: Issue created, Issue updated, Comment created
4. Save
```

### 4. Create Notion Database (1 minute)

Create a database in Notion called **"Feature Specs"** with these columns:

| Column        | Type   |
|---------------|--------|
| Feature Name  | Title  |
| Status        | Select |
| Priority      | Select |
| Linear Issue  | URL    |

Then:
```bash
1. Share database with your integration
2. Copy database ID from URL
3. Update ai_workflow_engine.py line 156
```

### 5. Deploy & Test (30 seconds)

```bash
# Deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Add AI workflows"
git push railway main

# Test
curl https://operator.blackroad.systems/webhooks/linear/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "integrations": {
    "linear": "configured",
    "notion": "configured",
    "huggingface": "configured"
  }
}
```
