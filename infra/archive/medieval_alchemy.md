## Connection to Amundson Framework

Alchemy was proto-science seeking:
- **Structure (Û)**: Fundamental elements (earth, water, air, fire)
- **Change (Ĉ)**: Transmutation, transformation
- **Strength (Ŝ)**: Concentration, potency, the "virtue" of substances
- **Scale (L̂)**: Microcosm/macrocosm correspondence

The alchemical motto **"As above, so below"** is a Scale operator:
```
L̂ |macro⟩ = |micro⟩
```

The Great Work sought Z = ∅ — perfect equilibrium between:
- Matter and spirit
- Base and noble
- Mortal and immortal
